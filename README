Matrix.java
V 1.0
By Stewart Bracken
Description - Matrix.java brings a rectangular matrix of arbitrary
              size to it's unique reduced row echelon form using
              gaussian elimination.
Usage: java matrix [-h -e -s] [InputFile]
       -h brings up this help panel.
       -e puts the input matrix into row echelon form, NOT reduced
          row echelon form. Keep in mind row echelon form is a
          non-unique form of a matrix, and may vary by the particular
          algorithm one uses. On the other hand, reduced row echelon
          form is unique, and every matrix has one.
       -s shows every step taken to reduce a matrix.
[InputFile] is a text file that consists of a rectangular matrix of
            integers of arbitrary size in which each integer is separated
            by a space and each row is separated by a line break.

Future releases may include:
 * Solving the matrix
 * output to a text file (you can always > yourself).
 * Vectors
 * Stuff I pick up in my linear algebra class.

Matrix.java
V 1.3
By Stewart Bracken

Description:
		 Matrix.java is a command line java program that brings
	    a rectangular matrix of arbitrary size to it's unique
		 reduced row echelon form using gaussian elimination.
		
Usage:
   java -jar matrix [-h | -e | -s] [InputFile]
   -h brings up this help panel.
   -e puts the input matrix into row echelon form, NOT reduced
      row echelon form. Keep in mind row echelon form is a
      non-unique form of a matrix, and may vary by the particular
      algorithm one uses. On the other hand, reduced row echelon
      form is unique, and every matrix has one.
   -s shows every step taken to reduce a matrix.

[InputFile]
      is a text file that consists of a rectangular matrix of
      integers of arbitrary size in which each integer is separated
      by a space and each row is separated by a line break. The input file
		must have correct formatting or unknown things will happen during
		this program's operation.

Future releases may include:
 * Check for validity of input matrix
 * Solving the matrix (depreciated)
 * output to a text file (you can always > yourself).
 * Vectors
 * Checking for consistency of a system.
 * Non/Homogoneous systems
 * Stuff I pick up in my linear algebra class.
 * ability to input fractions or decimals.
